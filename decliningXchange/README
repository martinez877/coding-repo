Nearly all students at the University of Rochester are required to pay for a meal plan (including "declining" dollars) regardless of their housing arrangements or personal lifestyle. Many students are required to purchase more declining dollars than they need and find it difficult to spend them all before they expire at the end of the year. decliningXchange is a platform designed to provide an alternative market for students to spend their declining dollars. It is comparable to other online platforms such as Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace in that current students with UR credentials can make posts offering goods, services, or other commodities for payment solely via declining dollars.
The platform operates such that the user creates a profile where they provide information such as their student ID. Upon login, the user is granted access to their user session. It is important to note that the user can only manipulate their own listings and activity (one user may not edit another user's activity or listings.) In order to find items to purchase (listings), you can either search by the name of the seller, the item name, the item ID, or order them by categories such as "most liked" or ascending/descending price. Additionally, we created two additional features, including one for "liking" posts and one for viewing your personal trading history, including a timestamp for each activity.
